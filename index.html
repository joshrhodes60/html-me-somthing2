                        <p>My partner and I started off the trip by flying into Denver. There we got to go visit the
                            Rockies baseball stadium and went sight seeing at the historic 16th street mall.</p>

                    <h2>Golden</h2>

                    <p>"In Golden we spent most of the day visiting the Coors light brewery. The brewery tour was really
                        good, you got to see how the different beers were made and even got some free ones after the
                        tour. Definetly a must if you are ever in that area."</p>

                    <h2>Morrison</h2>

                    <p>One of my favorite things of the trip was visiting Morrison. There we went to go visit the red
                        rock ampitheatre which is amazing.Although there wasn't a concert at the time I could only
                        imagine how cool that would be.</p>

                    <h2>Estes Park</h2>

                    <p>For the last day of the trip we made our way to Estes Park. There we started off by visiting the
                        Stanley Hotel where the shining and some other films were made.The whole property of the hotel
                        and seeing where the different scenes from movies were taken and the history of the place was
                        pretty amazing. Lastly we went on a 16 mile hike into the mountains to an amazing view as you
                        will see above. </p>
